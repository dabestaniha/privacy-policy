### Separated age groups
In our apps, we use book stories, audio stories and sometimes interesting clips, and provide content suitable for children under 10â€“12 years old.  
Content is categorized by age groups and each group sees its own relevant content.

### Use the app safely
There is no horror, violent, sexual, abusive, racist, anti-human or anti-child content in our apps.

**Free app and content without ads**  
We will not use advertising services such as *AdMob* to make money. So do not worry about unconventional and unwanted ads. We will also not provide user information to advertising services.

### Easy to use
Parents can disconnect the device from the internet after downloading stories and let their children use it safely, since our apps can run offline.

### Possible changes to the agreement
Clauses may be added to the agreement in the future or some sections may be amended. This right will be reserved for *Primary School* and our apps.  
Dear user, you are required to read this agreement after each installation or update, and your use of the app means acceptance of its rules.
